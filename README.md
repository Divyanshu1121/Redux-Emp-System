## 🔁 Redux Flow Explained

This project uses Redux for managing employee data efficiently.

### 🔸 Actions (`actions.jsx`)
```js
export const ADD_EMP = "ADD_EMP";
export const DEL_EMP = "DEL_EMP";
export const EDIT_EMP = "EDIT_EMP";
export const VIEW_EMP = "VIEW_EMP";
```
These constants are dispatched from components like `AddEmp`, `ViewEmp`, and `UpdateEmp` to modify the global state.

### 🔸 Reducer (`EmpReducer.jsx`)
Handles state updates based on the action types using a `switch` statement:
```js
switch(action.type) {
  case ADD_EMP:
    // logic to add employee
  ...
}
```

### 🔸 Store (`store.jsx`)
Sets up Redux with `localStorage` integration:
```js
const persistedState = loadState(); // Load state
const store = createStore(rootReducer, persistedState);
store.subscribe(() => saveState(store.getState())); // Save state
```

### 🔸 Local Storage (`localStorage.jsx`)
Persistent data mechanism:
```js
localStorage.setItem("employee", JSON.stringify(state));
```
This ensures employee data is preserved even after the browser is refreshed or reopened.

## 🎨 UI & Design

The user interface is designed for a clean and engaging user experience:

- Forms are visually centered with modern input styling and spacing.
- Tables feature striped rows for clarity, with hover states and clickable actions.
- Buttons are color-coded:
  - Green/Blue for Add or Update
  - Red for Delete
- Icons from React Icons add clarity for Edit (✏️) and Delete (🗑️) actions.
- Responsive design ensures usability on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
